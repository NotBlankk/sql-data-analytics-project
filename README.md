# sql-layoffs-eda

A SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on global layoffs across industries, companies, and years. This project uncovers patterns, trends, and outliers from a dataset of company layoffs using a wide variety of SQL queries â€” from simple aggregations to advanced window functions and common table expressions (CTEs).

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts aimed at performing a structured EDA on the dataset `layoffs` (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022) table. It includes insights like:


- **Largest layoffs** by company, location, and industry  
- **Trends** across years and months  
- **High-impact startups** that went out of business  
- **Rolling totals** and **yearly rankings**  
- Identification of **outliers** and interesting data points  

Each query is structured to explore a specific aspect of the dataset using best practices in SQL for readability and performance.
